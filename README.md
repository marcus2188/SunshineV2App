# SunshineV2App
2 years after my original 'Sunshine' language quiz game for IOS is developed, I seek to update the game's compatability, rewrite for a neater and more structured codebase, and finally integrating a live firebase realtime database with it. The original can be located here: https://github.com/marcus2188/SunshineApp 

As with the original, Sunshine V2 will feature 4 different modes: 
* Classic mode - A 3 lives only run to get the highest score
* Zen mode - A relaxing no time no lives style
* Odd one out mode - Choose the incorrect translation imposter amongst the correct ones
* Training mode - For learning all 3 different languages

Languages featured in Sunshine V2 include -> Chinese, Korean and Spanish

Here is how the IOS game app looks like:
