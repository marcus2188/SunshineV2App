# SunshineV2App
2 years after my original 'Sunshine' language quiz game for IOS is developed, I seek to update the game's compatability, rewrite for a neater and more structured codebase, and finally integrating a live firebase realtime database with it. The original can be located here: https://github.com/marcus2188/SunshineApp 

As with the original, Sunshine V2 will feature 4 different modes: 
* Classic mode - A 3 lives only run to get the highest score
* Zen mode - A relaxing no time no lives style
* Odd one out mode - Choose the incorrect translation imposter amongst the correct ones
* Training mode - For learning all 3 different languages

Languages featured in Sunshine V2 include -> Chinese, Korean and Spanish

Here is how the IOS game app looks like:

Sunshine V2 is an IOS game developed, tested and working only on iphones and up to the IPhone 13 pro max, running on IOS 14, with Xcode12.3 and swift 5. It does not work on IPads, apple watch or Apple TV so don't try.
